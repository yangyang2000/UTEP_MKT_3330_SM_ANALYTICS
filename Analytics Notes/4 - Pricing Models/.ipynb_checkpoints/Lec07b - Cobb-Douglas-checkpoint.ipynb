    "If you've watched a Beautiful Mind (recommended, good movie), you might be familiar with the name John Nash. He is the mathematician who is often credited with the \"discovery\" of game theory. In fact, the concept of equilibrium has existed long before in economics (Cournot) and mathematics (John von Neumann). What [Nash did do](https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/mudd/Digitization/AC105/AC105_Nash_John_Forbes_1950.pdf), was apply [Kakutani's fixed point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csInNn6pfT4) theorem to the finite game setting. Nash proved the existence of an equilibrium for every finite (in players and strategy) game. This was later expanded upon to show that there exists an [odd number of equilibria](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-always-an-odd-number-of-solutions-for-a-nash-equilibrium), and existence for [infinite but convex & compact strategy sets](http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1952-003-01/S0002-9939-1952-0046638-5/S0002-9939-1952-0046638-5.pdf). Nash's contemporary, von Neumann, criticized his dissertation essay that proved existence of Nash equilbirium as a trivial application of a fixed point theorem, something that he would give as a homework assignment to his grad students.\n",
