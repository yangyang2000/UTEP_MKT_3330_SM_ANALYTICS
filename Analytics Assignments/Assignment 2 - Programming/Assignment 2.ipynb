    "There's a thing called the CAPM model, aka the capital asset pricing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM model hypothesizes the following linear relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_a-R_f=\\alpha+\\beta(R_m-R_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $R_a-R_f$, the asset's risk premium (return on an asset above the risk free rate) is equal to some $\\alpha$ plus a multiplier, $\\beta$, times the market premium (market return above risk free), $R_m - R_f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$ is the systematic market risk factor for a stock (it sort of represents growth potential / market risk or how much the stock moves on average for some movement in the market), and $\\alpha$ is the excess return of a stock - what every investor is trying to find (excess returns = beating the market). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be analyzing data from the merged CRSP and COMPUSTAT files to compute $\\alpha$'s and $\\beta$'s for each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are provided with several files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The merged CRSP and COMPUSTAT monthly dataset (ccm.zip) from 2010-2016.\n",
    "2. The interest rate dataset (interestrates.zip)\n",
    "3. A variable description file (codebook.xlsx)\n",
    "4. An industry classification table (naics codes.xlsx)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some hints of how to work with the zipped files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you don't want it to take up a bunch of space on your computer, **do not unzip the files** (at least don't unzip the CCM file, it's about 300Mbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note that your computer should have at least 500mb ram to be able to do this. All modern computers should satisfy this requirement. You may want to exit out of other RAM intensive programs (video streaming, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to read the zipped file, use pandas' `read_csv` function, and specify ` compression='zip' ` as a named input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the monthly return of an asset, use the variable `trt1m` from the CCM file. This is the total holding period return adjusted for dividend payments for each asset. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For the risk free rate, use the variable `TCMNOM_M1` from the interest rates file. This is the 1 month treasury bill rate - we usually assume that the US government is \"risk free.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the CCM file, use `datadate` as the date variable. In the interest rate file, use `date` as the date variable."
