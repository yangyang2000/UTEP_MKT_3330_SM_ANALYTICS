    "1. Grab the 2016 regular season table for the Dallas Cowboys. The page is located here: http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/dal/year/2016\n",
    "2. Make sure your code can parse the data into:\n",
    "    1. home/away game\n",
    "    2. Opponent\n",
    "    3. own score \n",
    "    4. opponent score\n",
    "    5. Also create a new column that denotes the season (it'll be important for the next part).\n",
    "3. Once you're written the code for 2016, write the whole process as a function that takes the input \"season\" - i.e. the function grab_data(season) will take an interger of the season (such as 2016) and return a dataframe w/ the data needed.\n",
    "4. Write a loop to grab the data for the Cowboys since 1990.\n",
    "5. Create the following plots\n",
    "    1. Average point differential by season (x axis = season, y axis = pont differential)\n",
    "    2. Average point differential by season for home games\n",
    "    3. Average point differential by season for away games\n",
    "    4. Overlay these 3 plots in one plot\n",
    "    5. Plot the home vs. away point differential by season"
